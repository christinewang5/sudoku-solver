        number that's within the range of A. You should introduce any additional
        variables that you are needed. In order for our solution extractor to
        obtain the number of credits, for every course that you plan to take in
        the solution, you must have a variable named (courseId, semester) (e.g.
        ('COMP182', 'Fall2018') and it's assigned value is the number of credits.

        are different types of variables: courses and auxiliary variables with
        which you handle sums (e.g. (courseId, semester) and those added in get_sum_variable).
